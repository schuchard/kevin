# Angular Date Pipe

The Angular Date pipe is fantastic at formatting the majority of date-time manipulations. For example when you provide a date-time string to the `date` pipe it translates it to a more human readable format

```ts
const today = new Date(); # Mon Dec 16 2019 21:24:30 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)
...
{{today | date}} # Dec 16, 2019
```

Formatting the date-time is available in a number of ways, such as the pre-defined [formats](https://angular.io/api/common/DatePipe#pre-defined-format-options) or your own custom ones.

```html
{{today | date:'medium'}} # Dec 16, 2019, 9:24:30 PM
```

For most, this is exactly what you want, the date and local time of the user. But what if youâ€™re dealing with [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date-time [strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString) that are zero UTC offset. Going back to the example above we're not getting the zero offset time. That time would be:

```text
04:24:30.893Z
```

We can see the Angular Date pipe defaults to local time. Fortunately this is easily adjusted by providing the offset to the pipe as the 2nd [argument](https://angular.io/api/common/DatePipe#parameters).

```html
{{time | date:'HH:mm:ss':'+0:00'}} # 04:24:30
```
