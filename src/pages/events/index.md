    title: 'RMA: Testing: The Good Parts'
    description: >
      Presentation at the Rocky Mountain Angular meetup on Angular testing patterns. Testing if often thought off as having no obvious ROI, not worth the effort, or too difficult to maintain. Developers just want to build right? Yet companies often spend their resources manually verifying that features "still work" after every release. When it comes to testing, the DRY principal applies too. If you're repeatedly testing something it's time to automate it.

      It's also common for applications to reach a level of maturity where introducing new features simultaneously introduces new bugs. We've all experienced, or written ;), a file that no one wants to touch. While a discussion for refactoring is in order, you should also consider writing tests around itâ€™s expected functionality so that you can confidently make changes without the fear introducing more bugs.
