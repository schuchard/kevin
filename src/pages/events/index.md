    title: 'RMA - Testing: The Good Parts'
    description: >
      Presentation at the Rocky Mountain Angular meetup on Angular testing patterns. Testing if often thought off as having no obvious ROI, not worth the effort, or too difficult to maintain. Developers just want to build right? Yet companies often spend their resources manually verifying that features "still work" after every release. When it comes to testing, the DRY principal applies too. If you're repeatedly testing something it's time to automate it.

      It's also common for applications to reach a level of maturity where introducing new features simultaneously introduces new bugs. We've all experienced, or written ;), a file that no one wants to touch. While a discussion for refactoring is in order, you should also consider writing tests around it’s expected functionality so that you can confidently make changes without the fear introducing more bugs.

    title: 'NgConf - Schematics: an untapped frontier'
    description: >
      Schematics can accomplish nearly any task and published by anyone. Whether you want to generate hundreds of dynamic files or update source code, Kevin and Brian will demonstrate how accessible custom schematics are for you or your organization. If you find yourself repeating the same logic, enforcing similar patterns, or performing setup logic, again and again, you’ll take away the tools and understanding necessary to start your schematic learning journey.
